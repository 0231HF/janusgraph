  Provides special purpose attribute implementations for use as property data types and classes to handle ranges of attributes.
  Attribute ranges are needed to query for all nodes which have an attribute in a range of values. When querying for attribute
  ranges it must be ensured that the attribute values are linearly ordered and that the index is aware of that ordering. Hence,
  such attribute data types need special treatment which is provided in this package.
