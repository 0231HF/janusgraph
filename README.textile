Faunus is a framework for processing "property graphs":https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki/Property-Graph-Model using "Hadoop":http://hadoop.apache.org/. A "vertex-centric":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list data structure is processed using the graph traversal language "Gremlin":http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com. Faunus is useful for generating graph derivations and basic graph statistics. Faunus can be extended with new operations written using "MapReduce":http://hadoop.apache.org/mapreduce/ and "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com.
