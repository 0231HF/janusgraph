Titan is a distributed "graph database":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database optimized for processing massive-scale graphs represented over a machine cluster. Titan separates the concerns of graph query and manipulation from storing the graph on disk, delegating that concern to an extensible set of NoSQL solutions.

h2. General Titan Benefits

* Support for "infinite" sized graphs via the addition of machines to the cluster.
* Native support for the popular property graph data model exposed by Blueprints.
* Native support for the graph traversal language Gremlin.
* Numerous graph-level configurations provide knobs for tuning performance.
* Micro-indices facilitate intelligent vertex-level querying to alleviate issues with the infamous super node problem.
* Provides an optimized disk representation to allow for efficient use of storage and speed of access.
* Data replication amongst the cluster ensures data is protected during machine failures.
* Support for top-down, user prescribed graph partitioning algorithms.

h2. Benefits of Titan on Cassandra

* Continuously available with no single point of failure.
* No read/write bottlenecks to the graph as there is no master/slave architecture.
* Elastic scalability allows for the introduction and removal of machines.
* Caching layer ensures that continuously accessed data is available in memory.
* Increase the size of the cache by adding more machines to the cluster.

h2. Benefits of Titan on HBase
