Titan is a distributed "graph database":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database optimized for processing massive-scale graphs represented over a machine cluster. Titan separates the concerns of graph processing and manipulation from storing the graph on disk, delegating that concern to an extensible set of persistence solutions.
