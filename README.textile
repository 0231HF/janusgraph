Faunus is a "Hadoop":http://hadoop.apache.org/ based distributed computing framework for "property graphs":https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki/Property-Graph-Model. A "breadth-first":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search version of the graph traversal language "Gremlin":http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com operates on a "vertex-centric":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list property graph data structure. Faunus can be extended with new operations written using "MapReduce":http://hadoop.apache.org/mapreduce/ and "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com.
