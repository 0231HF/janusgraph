The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is a filesystem that is supported by the nodes in the Hadoop compute cluster. HDFS has numerous similarities to typical filesystems such as those of the "*nix":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux variety. The @hadoop@ CLI utility provides a "collection of commands":http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.0.3/file_system_shell.html that can be run from the local command line.

Gremlin provides methods to easily interact with both the local file system and HDFS from within the REPL. These methods are provided in the table below. Note that the global variables @local@ and @hdfs@ reference the local and HDFS file systems, respectively. Finally, _pattern_ refers to a regular expression pattern and _path_ refers to an explicit path to a file or directory.

<br/><br/>

|_. Method |_. Description |
| @ls()@ | list all the contents in the home directory |
| @ls(pattern)@ | list all the contents that match the pattern |
| @result(path)@ | display the directory of the final result of a Faunus job |
| @exists(path)@ | return true or false on whether path exists |
| @rm(pattern)@ | remove all paths that match the pattern |
| @rmr(pattern)@ | recursively remove all paths that match the pattern |
| @copyToLocal(from,to)@ | copy the HDFS path to the local filesystem |
| @copyFromLocal(from,to)@ | copy the local path to HDFS |
| @mergeToLocal(from,to)@ | merge the files at hdfs path to a single file on the local filesystem |
| @head(pattern,lines?)@ | look at the top @?lines@ of the files that match pattern |
| @unzip(from,to,delete)@ | "BZ2":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bzip2 unzip the path to another path |
